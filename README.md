Feb 21 | Yesterday, based on the ability of the Sugarchain main chain to transfer funds quickly (it only takes a few seconds), the development team seriously discussed the feasibility of Sugarchain as a mobile payment method in troubled areas (such as war, riots, economic collapse, etc.) and named it temporarily "SugarPay". We have considered possible legal issues, the feasibility of full decentralization, the payment amount and the location of application scenarios, the possibility of block forks, the workload of various modules, user processes, etc. Question, we think that users can use BTC as a means of storing funds in troubled areas, and then exchange it for Sugar through AtomicSwap, and then make small mobile payments. We look forward to officially initiating projects in the near future and using SugarPay as the main stage, direction of development.
